**Version:** 1.5
**Date:** 2025-04-04

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) Test Plan and Strategy for the portfolio website application. The goal is to ensure the application meets quality standards, is production-ready, and provides a positive user experience across various scenarios and environments.

## 2. Project Overview & Analysis

Based on the project structure, the application is a Next.js/React-based portfolio website. Key components identified include:

*   **Pages:** Home (`/`), About (`/about`), Contact (`/contact`), Projects list (`/projects`), Project detail (`/projects/[slug]`), Terms (`/terms`), Privacy (`/privacy`).
*   **Layout:** Main application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
*   **Core Components:** Header, Footer (`site-footer.tsx`, `ui/footer.tsx`), Project Card, Theme Provider, Waves Hero/Background.
*   **UI Elements:** Buttons, Cards, Forms (Input, Label, Textarea), Navigation Menu, Theme Toggle, Toasts (`sonner.tsx`).
*   **Potential Backend Integration:** Supabase client (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`) likely used for contact form submission or other dynamic data.
*   **Configuration:** Site metadata (`src/config/site.ts`).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css`).

## 3. Testing Strategy

A multi-faceted testing strategy will be employed to ensure comprehensive coverage, incorporating different levels of the testing pyramid:

*   **Static Analysis & Build Verification:** Before other testing, ensure the code adheres to quality standards and the application builds successfully. This includes:
    *   Running the linter (ESLint) to catch code style and potential errors.
    *   Running the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to check for type errors.
    *   Executing the production build command (`npm run build`) to confirm it completes without errors (including linting and type checking steps integrated into the build). **This is a critical pre-deployment check.**
    *   Verifying component imports resolve correctly (no 'Module not found' errors).
    *   Checking for type errors (`tsc --noEmit` or via build process).
*   **Unit & Component Testing:** Test individual functions (e.g., utility functions in `src/lib/utils.ts`) and React components in isolation to verify their logic and rendering without needing to run the entire application. Tools like Jest and React Testing Library are suitable.
*   **Integration Testing:** Focus on the interaction between different parts of the application, such as:
    *   Interactions between multiple components (e.g., form submission triggering a toast notification).
    *   Frontend communication with backend services (e.g., Supabase client integration for the contact form).
    *   Verifying data fetching logic targets correct database tables and columns.
    *   Ensuring TypeScript types align with the actual database schema.
    *   Checking UI behavior and error handling when optional data (e.g., images) is missing.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate real user scenarios by interacting with the application through the browser. Verify complete user flows (e.g., navigating to the contact page, filling the form, submitting, and seeing a success message). Playwright is recommended.
*   **Functional Testing:** Manually or exploratorily verify that each feature works according to requirements (e.g., navigation links work, theme changes apply correctly). Both positive and negative test cases will be included.
*   **Regression Testing:** Execute a subset of automated tests (E2E, Integration, Unit/Component) after code changes or bug fixes to ensure existing functionality remains unaffected.
*   **Usability Testing:** Evaluate the ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user experience of the website. This can involve heuristic evaluation or user feedback sessions.
*   **Compatibility Testing:** Ensure the website renders and functions correctly across different browsers, operating systems, and device types (responsive design).
    *   **Target Browsers:** Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
    *   **Target Devices:** Desktop (various resolutions), Mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), Tablet.
*   **Performance Testing:** Assess the website's responsiveness, load times, stability, and resource utilization under various conditions.
    *   **Frontend Performance (Client-Side):**
        *   **Core Web Vitals:** Measure LCP, FID/INP, and CLS using tools like Lighthouse and real user monitoring (RUM) if available. Focus on optimizing these metrics for key pages (Home, About, Contact).
        *   **Load Times:** Analyze Page Load Time (PLT), Time to First Byte (TTFB), and First Contentful Paint (FCP). Identify bottlenecks in resource loading (CSS, JS, images, fonts).
        *   **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use tools like `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect JavaScript bundle sizes. Identify opportunities for code splitting, tree shaking, and reducing dependencies to minimize initial load JS.
        *   **Image Optimization:** Verify that images are appropriately sized, compressed, and served in modern formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF) using Next.js Image component (`next/image`) effectively. Check for lazy loading implementation.
        *   **Rendering Performance:** Analyze rendering times for both Server Components and Client Components in Next.js. Profile React component rendering if specific components seem slow.
        *   **Caching:** Verify browser caching headers are set correctly for static assets.
    *   **Backend/Integration Performance (if applicable):**
        *   **API Response Times:** Measure the time taken for the Supabase client to handle operations, particularly the contact form submission.
        *   **Database Performance:** If complex queries are used via Supabase, analyze their performance (though less likely for a simple portfolio).
    *   **Load Testing:**
        *   **Goal:** Simulate expected user traffic to ensure the application remains responsive and stable under normal conditions.
        *   **Scenario:** Simulate concurrent users browsing different pages (Home, About, Projects) and submitting the contact form.
        *   **Tools:** k6, Artillery (primarily if testing backend endpoints directly). Lighthouse can provide initial insights under simulated throttling.
    *   **Stress Testing:**
        *   **Goal:** Intentionally overload the application (frontend rendering, backend requests if applicable) to identify performance bottlenecks, breaking points, and resource limits (CPU, memory).
        *   **Scenario:** Gradually increase simulated user load beyond expected peaks until performance degrades significantly or errors occur.
        *   **Tools:** k6, Artillery.
*   **Security Testing:** Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, focusing on common web application risks and best practices for Next.js and Supabase.
    *   **Focus Areas & Techniques:**
        *   **OWASP Top 10:** Systematically test for common vulnerabilities:
            *   **A01: Broken Access Control:** Verify that there are no exposed Supabase admin keys or sensitive endpoints accessible without proper authorization (though less relevant for a simple portfolio unless more features exist).
            *   **A02: Cryptographic Failures:** Ensure sensitive data (like contact form submissions) is transmitted securely over HTTPS. Check Supabase configuration for data-at-rest encryption.
            *   **A03: Injection:** Test contact form inputs for potential injection attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads, basic SQL injection patterns, although Supabase client libraries often mitigate direct SQLi). Sanitize all user inputs displayed back on the page.
            *   **A04: Insecure Design:** Review the design of the contact form submission process â€“ is there rate limiting? Is data validation performed server-side (if using Supabase functions) or just client-side?
            *   **A05: Security Misconfiguration:** Check HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) using browser DevTools or online scanners. Verify Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies if applicable (likely relevant if Supabase is used for more than just form submission). Ensure `.env.local` or environment variables containing secrets (like Supabase keys) are not accidentally committed or exposed client-side.
            *   **A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies (Next.js, React, UI libraries, Supabase client).
            *   **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures:** Not directly applicable unless user accounts exist.
            *   **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Ensure dependencies are fetched from trusted sources.
            *   **A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:** Review Supabase logs (if accessible) for suspicious activity after testing.
            *   **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Less likely in this context unless the application makes server-side requests based on user input.
        *   **Data Protection:** Verify contact form data handling complies with privacy best practices. Ensure data sent to Supabase is handled securely according to its configuration.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use `npm audit` / `yarn audit` as part of the routine.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Confirm that Supabase API keys (especially service keys, if used) are stored securely as environment variables and *not* exposed in the client-side bundle. Check `next.config.ts` and component code for accidental exposure.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Test contact form for potential abuse (e.g., submitting many times quickly). Consider if server-side rate limiting (e.g., via Supabase Functions or edge functions) is needed.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and test a strict CSP to mitigate XSS risks.
*   **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities, adhering to accessibility standards.
    *   **Target Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

## 9. Test Schedule & Resources (Placeholder)

*   **Schedule:** To be defined based on development milestones.
*   **Resources:** QA Engineer(s), Developer support for bug fixing, Access to testing tools and environments.

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

*   **Risk:** Incomplete Supabase integration testing due to lack of backend visibility.
    *   **Mitigation:** Collaborate with developers to understand Supabase setup (RLS policies, functions used), potentially use Supabase logs or mock data for testing. Ensure Supabase keys are handled securely.
*   **Risk:** Inconsistent testing across different environments.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure staging environment closely mirrors production; automate environment setup where possible. Document environment configurations.
*   **Risk:** Regression bugs introduced by new features/fixes.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust automated regression suite (Playwright/Cypress, potentially unit/integration tests) run frequently (e.g., on every commit/PR to staging). Maintain and update the suite regularly.
*   **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks under load or due to large bundles/assets.
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct load testing early if significant dynamic functionality exists; optimize frontend assets (images, JS bundles) and backend queries (if applicable). Monitor Core Web Vitals and bundle sizes against benchmarks.
*   **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities missed by automated scans.
    *   **Mitigation:** Combine automated scanning (ZAP, npm audit) with manual checks (input validation, secrets exposure, header review) and secure coding practices awareness.
*   **Risk:** Build/Lint errors missed before QA/deployment.
    *   **Mitigation:** Integrate `npm run build` check into CI pipeline and/or make it an explicit first step in the QA process for staging/pre-production environments.

## 11. Sign-off

This plan requires review and approval from project stakeholders before test execution begins.
