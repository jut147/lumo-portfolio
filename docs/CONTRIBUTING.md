# Contributing to JT's Portfolio Website

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

*   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jut147/portfolio-website/issues).
*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jut147/portfolio-website/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

*   Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement suggestion. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and its potential benefits.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch (or the primary development branch).

#### Pull Request Guidelines

*   Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
*   Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
*   Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
*   You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

*   Follow the existing code style.
*   Run `npm run lint` (or equivalent) to check for linting errors before submitting.
